# This readme file explains how to process raw nanopore reads with UMIs

primer_position - finds primer positions in raw nanopore reads 
nanopore_pipeline - resolving UMIs
Orientation - orientation of UMIs
(Clustering_99 - to cluster 18S genes at 99% ID to get an idea of diversity)
Trimming - trimming away primers and adaptors 
ASVs - denoising to get FL-ASVs
Barrnap - finds 18S genes from FL-ASVs
Taxonomy - taxonomic annotation (closest neighbour) of 18S genes 
Place - taxonomic annotation (EPA) of 18S genes
