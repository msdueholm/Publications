# Uncovering the genetic potential for exopolysaccharide synthesis in activated sludge bacteria by genome-resolved metagenomic

Code for the analysis and visualisation in the article. 

The proximity filtration is performed from `/main.R`, which calls upon `/scripts/proximity_filtration.R` and `/scripts/plot_operon.R`. 

Visualitation of HQ-MAG tree annotated with results is performed with `/scripts/GQ_MAG_tree.R`.

Shell commands for PSI-BLAST and interproscan can be found in `/scripts/shell/`.
